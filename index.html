            <p>At ServeHer, we believe that every female athlete should be able to compete and train without barriers. Unfortunately, many women in sports do not have access to essential menstrual products. We’re here to change that!</p>
            <p>Menstrual health is not just a women’s issue—it’s a human right. Not having access to menstrual products can cause unnecessary stress and discomfort for female athletes. By providing these products for free, we are ensuring that these athletes can focus on their performance and success!</p>
            <p>ServeHer's objective is simple yet powerful: to provide tennis clubs in Ontario with free menstrual products. We partner with tennis clubs across Ontario to make menstrual products available for those who need them. And through fundraising events, donations, and the shared belief that every woman should have access to essential products, we are working towards a future where no female athlete has to worry about menstrual hygiene during training or competition!</p>
