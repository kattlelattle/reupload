            <h2>Angelina Patel</h2>
            <p>Hi, my name is Angelina! After experiencing the discomfort of starting my period without access to menstrual products at tennis, I realized the need for change. ServeHer is driven by my passion for community service and the belief that no one should be caught unprepared.</p>
            <p>Alongside my passion for ServeHer, I have a love for listening to music, indulging in romcoms, and going on sweet treat runs.</p>

            <h2>Katherine Zhang</h2>
            <p>Hey! I'm Katherine and as a tennis player, I've experienced and witnessed the pressures women encounter both on and off the court. Having the right support and resources makes a world of difference, which is why I'm dedicated to making sure female athletes have what they need to succeed!</p>
            <p>When I'm not working on ServeHer, you can find me tinkering away at crafts and projects, or curled up with a good book.</p>
